# Project-J
project has the details of my end term evaluation of various sensors
The whole project is just for the learning process and check the outcomes of different sensors and utilizing the output in python.

What's happening here.?
Let me explain..
    I wanted a couple to sensor to detect the active elements of the environment of a working machinery, like Heat, Pressure, Flow of liquid, humidity in a particular time spam.
    After reading the values we are taking them to a database.
    The readings would be stored after every hour, while the program take reading from sensor in every minute and write the database after evaluating the avg rise and avg fall
    in that hour.
    
    I would also like to show this reading graphically with all the five elements that are being monitored., temp, pressure, flow, level and humidity
    
    If anybody is going to use the code for their project, I wish them all the best and If you find anything that can be optimised or going wrong please 
    let me know and share it me at the earliest. I will be verry thankful for that. And please also share your queries if any.
